        <b>Class Scope : </b>
        This is when a variable (attribute) is declared just inside the first line of a class
        after the first brace {. The scope of this variable covers the whole class
        which includes any methods inside the class. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Data Encapsulation : </b>
        is the process of hiding implementation details, which is achieved by
        bundling the methods and variables of a class reprsentaion in the class.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Private :</b>
        This is an access modifier which is put in front of your class variables declarations.
        Only methods defined inside a class definition can have access 
        to or are able to change the value of the variable. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Public : </b>
        This allows other code to call these methods using an instance of an object and the 
        dot “.” operator followed by the method name. 
        You allow the public to have a way of accessing your attributes. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Information Hiding : </b>
        only allowing the methods defined within a class to have access to or change the values of the attributes of the class. 
        Achieved by declaring the class attribute variables to using the access modifier private in front of their declarations.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Inheritance :</b>
         is the process of creating a new class from an existing class.
         It is a very important ability because it allows the programmer to develop and extend software 
         which is dependent on previously proven super classes.<br>
         <br>
         <b>Overriding Methods : </b>
         When a method is overridden in a subclass, and that method is invoked on an instance of the subclass, 
         it is the overridden version of the method that is executed. The subclass method must have the same name and 
         parameter types as the superclass method it overrides. <br>
         <br>
         <b>Method Overloading :</b>
         Creating multiple versions of the same method with different parameters.

        <p>
        <b>Writing Class constructor methods</b> <br>
        <ul>
            <li>The Class constructor method name is the same as the name of the Class itself</li>
            <li>The constructor method never returns a value or type although it appears to do so</li>
            <li>The constructor needs to be accessible from outside the class <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr;  Needs to be <i>public</i>
            </li>
            <li>You can have multiple versions of the class constructor method <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr;  Method overloading
            </li>
        </ul>
        The key word <i>this</i> followed by the dot “.” operator allows you to specify 
        which variable you are referring to explicitly. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>this.x refers to the class instance variable x</i> <br>
        <br>
        <b>Example Code : </b> <br>
        public class Point { <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;private int x;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;private int y;<br>
        
            &nbsp;&nbsp;public Point(int x, int y) {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    this.x = x;<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    this.y = y;<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
        
                &nbsp;&nbsp;public int getX() {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    return x;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
        
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;public void setX(int x) {<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    this.x = x;<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;public int getY() {<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    return y;<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
        
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;public void setY(int y) {<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   this.y = y;<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
        
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;public void printPoint() {<br>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   System.out.println("Point coordinates are (" + x + "," + y + ")");<br>
                                    &nbsp;}<br>
