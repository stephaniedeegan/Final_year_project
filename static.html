        A java method is a bundle of lines of code with a common function.
        Methods also define the behaviour of Classes in object oriented programming.<br>
        <br>
        Writing methods allows us to maintain important code or algorithms that are used in repeatedly in different places in our applications.<br>
        <br>
        A method must be written or declared before it can be used.
        After it is declared it is used by calling or invoking it in your program.<br>
       <br>
        <b>Method Declaration:</b><br>
         Access_modifiers   return_type  method_name( formal_parameter_list)<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    statements; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
        <br>
        <b>Example</b><br>
            public static void printHello (  )<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    System.out.println(“Hello world”);<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
             <br>
            <b>Formal Method Declaration:</b><br>

            access_modifiers  return_type  method_name (formal parameter list)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;statements;  // if the return type is not void then you need a return statement.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
            <br>
            <b>Example</b><br>
            public static int addTwoNumbers ( int x, int y )  <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return x + y;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
             <i>The <b>int</b> here declares that we want to return an int.</i><br>
             
            

       </p>
   
    </div>

    <div class="rtext" style="width: 45%; height: 675px; float: left;">
        <p>The Scanner class is defined in the java.util package. To import it, include either 
            <i>import java.util.*;</i> or <i>import java.util.Scanner;</i> at the top of your programme.
            <br>
            To create an instance of the Scanner class:<br>
            <b> &rarr; Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)</b><br>
            <br>
            <i>nextInt() - int number = sc.nextInt( ); </i> // reads in the next token as an Integer<br>
            <i>nextLine() - int sentence = sc.nextLine( );</i>// reads in the next token as an String<br>
            <br>
            <b>Rules for Declaring Methods</b>
            <ul>
                <li>The 1st line of tells the programmer how the method should be used.<br>
                    &rarr; <i>Method Signature</i>
                </li>
                <li>The number of parameters in the call to the method must match the type and number of parameters  in the method declaration</li>
                <li>If the return type is not void, then the method statements must contain
                    the return statement
                </li>
                <li>Method name have to obey rules for legal identifiers.
                    As a code convention rule, the 1st letter in the identifier is 
                    a small letter, and the remaining words hvae their 1st letter captialised.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <b>Scope &nbsp;: </b> is the portion of the program from which the 
            variable can be addressed.<br>
            There are 2 types of scope &nbsp;&rarr; <i>block</i> and <i>class</i><br>
            <br>
             A variable that is defined within a method is called a <i> local variable.</i><br>
             The variable declared in a for statement only extends to the structure of that statement.<br>
             You can't declare two variables with the same name in the same method as their scopes overlap.<br>
            <br><b>Static Variables &nbsp;: </b> Methods and attributes which are Static have one “version” of them.<br>
            <i>public</i> and <i>private</i> are called Access Modifiers.<br>
            &nbsp;&rarr; private methods can NOT be seen by other classes <br>
            <br>
            You can define two or more methods within the same class that share the same name, as long as their parameter declarations are different. 
            &nbsp;&rarr;These are called <b>overloaded methods</b>
