        <p>A Turing Machine is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine. 
            It consists of a read/write head with a paper tape passing through it<br>
            The Turing Machine was invented by Alan Turing.<br>
            <br>
            The tape is of unbounded length and divided into squares.<br>It serves both as the means of input and output 
            and also as a working memory for storing the results of intermediate steps of the computation.<br>
            There must be a finite number of symbols used in the alphabet that the Turing machine can recognise.<br>
            <br>
            There are 6  fundamental operations that a Turing machine performs :  
            <ul>
                <li>Read the symbol that the head is currently over</li>
                <li>Write a symbol on the square the head is currently over</li>
                <li>Move the tape left one position </li>
                <li>Move the tape right one position </li>
                <li>Change state</li>
                <li>Halt</li>
            </ul>
            An instruction table for a Turing machine is a finite collection of instructions.<br>
            <br>
            Each instruction is of the form : <br>
            <br>
            If the current state is n and the symbol under the head is x, then write y on the square under the 
            head, go to state m, and move one square left or right. <br>

        </p>

        <div class="rtext" style="width: 50%; height: 500px; float: left;">
    
            <p>
                There are three special states : 
            <ul>
                <li>Start state</li>
                <li>Accept state</li>
                <li>Reject state</li>
            </ul>
                The Turing Machine computes until it produces an output. <br>
            If it never enters an accepting or rejecting state the Turing Machine goes on forever. <br>
            The purpose of designated halt states is to indicate when the machine has finished computing.<br>
            <br>
                Definition of TM  is T = (Q,Σ,┌,q0,δ).<br>
                <ul>
                   <li>Q is the finite set of states</li>
                   <li>Σ represents the input alphabet</li>
                   <li>┌ is the tape alphabet</li>
                   <li>q0 is the starting state</li>
                   <li>δ is the transition function </li>
                </ul>
                The <i>Church-Turing Thesis</i> states that the capabilities of Turing machines are equivalent to those of any other computational device.
