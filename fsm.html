        <p>A FSM is a mathematical model of computation that describes a system's behavior as a 
            set of states and transitions. <br> 
            A FSM describes the behaviour of a Regular Expression (RegEx). 
            Each FSM is composed of the following 5-tuple <b>(Q, Σ, δ, q0, F)</b>:<br>
            <ul>
            <li> a finite set of states</li>
            <li>Σ: a finite alphabet set </li>
            <li>δ: transition function - a set of maps from states and inputs into states </li>
            <li>q0: an initial state </li>
            <li>F: a set of final/accepting states<br>with line breaks.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>There are 2 special states: Start and Finish <br>
            <br>
            <b>Start State </b> : The FSM always begins in this state. It is 
            usually represented with an arrow pointing at it. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Finish State</b> : The FSM must finish in this state. There can be multiple.
            Finish states are those where the machine accepts the input.Accepting states are 
            usually represented by double circles. <br>
            <br>
            A transition is a connection between two states that describes the machine's behavior. <br>
            <br>
            All accepted strings for FSM’s should be ordered lexicographically. <br>
        </p>

        <div class="rtext" style="width: 50%; height: 500px; float: left;">
        <p><b>Determinstic Finite State Automata (DFA) </b> <br>
            A deterministic finite automata (DFA) is a type of FSM that 
            has only one transition for each label in a state. <br>
            They are machines in which each transition is uniquely determined by the current state and input <br>
            <br>
            <b>Non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) </b> <br>
            A NFA allows for multiple transitions with the same label for many states. <br>
            A NFA has more than one entry in at least one cell of the State Transition Table. <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Both NFA and DFA only recognise regular languages</li>
                <li>DFA and NFA have distinct definitions, but it can be shown that they are equivalent. 
                    That is, for any NFA we can construct an equivalent DFA and vice versa</li>
            </ul>
